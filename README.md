# RAD-140 CS2
my attempt at optimizng/multithreading. my goal is to make a simplistic yet powerful cs2 external. I'm  new to cheat development, as I started 2/26/2024. I'm gonna make this a perm repository so i can update it and fully release it so yall can have a decent cheat base. This source is nowhere near the best at all. If you have anyinput on it please feel free to message me on discord at : "pointertoobject".
